üöÄ Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

Prerequisites
You will need a Google account to create a Firebase project.

Installation
Clone the repo

git clone https://github.com/your-username/meethe.git

Navigate to the project directory

cd meethe

Set up Firebase

Go to the Firebase Console and create a new project.

In your project, go to Project Settings > General.

Under "Your apps", click the web icon (</>) to create a new web app.

Copy the firebaseConfig object.

In both index.html and admin.html, find the <script type="module"> section and replace the placeholder firebaseConfig object with the one you just copied.

// Inside index.html and admin.html

const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
  messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
  appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
};

Enable Firebase Services

In the Firebase console, go to the Build section.

Click on Firestore Database and create a database in production mode.

Click on Storage and enable it.

Click on Authentication, go to the "Sign-in method" tab, and enable Anonymous sign-in.

Set Firestore Security Rules

Go to the Firestore Database > Rules tab.

Replace the default rules with the following to allow public read access but restrict writes:

rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Allow public read access to all collections
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read: if true;
    }

    // Allow anyone (including admins on the client-side) to write to these collections.
    // For a production app, you would want to lock this down to authenticated admins.
    match /artifacts/{appId}/public/data/{collection}/{docId} {
       allow write: if true;
    }
  }
}

Open the files in your browser

Simply open index.html to see the main website.
